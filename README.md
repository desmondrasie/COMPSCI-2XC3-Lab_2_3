# COMPSCI-2XC3-Lab_2_3

Purpose
This lab focuses on implementing, analysing, and optimizing some traditional sorting algorithms. This lab
will span two weeks. In the first week you will cover the following (but not limited to):
- Compare the runtimes of Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sorts
- Implement variations of each Bubble and Selection sort and run experiments to determine how
much (if any) improvements you observe
- Analyse the performance of these algorithms under specific cases such as short lists and if the
list are “near sorted”
During the second week you will cover the following (but not limited to):
- Compare the runtimes of Merge, Quick, and Heap sorts
- Implement variations on Merge and Quick sort and run experiments to determine how much (if
any) improvements you observe
- Analyse the performance of these algorithms under specific cases such as short lists and if the
list are “near sorted”
- Determine if a “hybrid” search strategy would be beneficial
- Implement your sorting algorithms via a strategy pattern (we’ll see how the workload is)
