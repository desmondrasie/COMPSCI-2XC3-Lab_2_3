# In the file bad_sorts.py posted alongside this document, you will find implementations of Bubble,
# Insertion, and Selection sort. Run suitable experiments to compare the runtimes of these three
# algorithms. In bad_sorts there is a create_random_list function which may be useful. In your report this
# section should include:

#  An explicit outline of the experiments you ran. That is, list length values, how many “runs”, etc.
#  A graph of list length vs time displaying the three curves corresponding to the three “bad”
# sorting algorithms
#  A brief discussion and conclusion regarding the results. A few sentences are fine here.


# Create a random list length "length" containing whole numbers between 0 and max_value inclusive
def create_random_list(length, max_value):
    return [random.randint(0, max_value) for _ in range(length)]


# Creates a near sorted list by creating a random list, sorting it, then doing a random number of swaps
def create_near_sorted_list(length, max_value, swaps):
    L = create_random_list(length, max_value)
    L.sort()
    for _ in range(swaps):
        r1 = random.randint(0, length - 1)
        r2 = random.randint(0, length - 1)
        swap(L, r1, r2)
    return L

# I have created this function to make the sorting algorithm code read easier
def swap(L, i, j):
    L[i], L[j] = L[j], L[i]

# This is the traditional implementation of Insertion Sort.
def insertion_sort(L):
    for i in range(1, len(L)):
        insert(L, i)


def insert(L, i):
    while i > 0:
        if L[i] < L[i-1]:
            swap(L, i-1, i)
            i -= 1
        else:
            return


# This is the optimization/improvement we saw in lecture
def insertion_sort2(L):
    for i in range(1, len(L)):
        insert2(L, i)


def insert2(L, i):
    value = L[i]

        if L[i - 1] > value:
            L[i] = L[i - 1]
            i -= 1
        else:
            L[i] = value
            return
    L[0] = value
